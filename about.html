                                The Texas Legislature established the Texas Centers for Border Economic and Enterprise Development by an act passed by the 71st Legislature (1989).

                                Since 1989 the Texas Center for Border Economic and Enterprise Development of Texas A&M International University, provides leadership and support to Texas border communities in their socio-economic development efforts, including activities in the areas of business, education, health care, public administration, and the environment.<br> <br>
